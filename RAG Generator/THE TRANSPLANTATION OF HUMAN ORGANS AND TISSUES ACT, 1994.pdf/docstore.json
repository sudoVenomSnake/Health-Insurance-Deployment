Other states could adopt the Act via resolution under article 252 of the Constitution.\n\nThe Act is structured into several chapters, detailing preliminary information, authority for organ and tissue removal, regulation of hospitals, the appropriate authority and advisory committees, registration of hospitals and tissue banks, offences and penalties, and miscellaneous provisions.\n\nKey definitions include \"donor\" as a person authorizing organ or tissue removal, \"hospital\" encompassing various medical institutions, \"human organ\" as a part of the body with structured tissues, \"near relative\" including family members, \"recipient\" as the person receiving the organ or tissue, and \"transplantation\" as the grafting of organs or tissues for therapeutic purposes.\n\nThe Act outlines the conditions under which human organs or tissues can be removed, including the consent of the donor, and establishes an appropriate authority for overseeing the process. It also sets regulations for hospitals conducting removal, storage, or transplantation, and mandates the registration of such hospitals and tissue banks.\n\nOffences and penalties are specified for unauthorized removal, commercial dealings, and contraventions of the Act. The Act provides protection for actions taken in good faith and grants the power to make rules for its implementation.

If a donor has provided written authorization in the presence of two witnesses (one being a near relative), the person in possession of the body must facilitate organ or tissue removal unless there is reason to believe the donor revoked consent.\n\n3.

Only registered medical practitioners can remove organs or tissues, except for cornea removal, which can be done by a qualified technician.\n\n5. Before removing organs or tissues from a deceased person, a registered medical practitioner must personally examine the body to confirm death, including brain-stem death, which must be certified by a board of medical experts.\n\n6. In the case of brain-stem death in minors, parents can authorize organ or tissue removal.\n\n7. Organ or tissue removal is not authorized if an inquest is required or if the body is solely entrusted for interment, cremation, or disposal.\n\n8. Unclaimed bodies in hospitals or prisons can have organs or tissues removed for therapeutic purposes by the person in charge after 48 hours from the time of death, provided no near relative is likely to claim the body.\n\n9. Bodies sent for post-mortem examination for medico-legal or pathological purposes can have organs or tissues removed if they are not required for examination, and the deceased did not object to donation or had given consent that was not revoked.\n\n10. Removed organs or tissues must be preserved as prescribed by a registered medical practitioner.\n\n11. The Act does not render unlawful any dealings with a deceased person's body that would have been lawful prior to the Act.\n\n12. Removal of organs or tissues in accordance with the Act is not considered an offense under the Indian Penal Code.\n\n13.
