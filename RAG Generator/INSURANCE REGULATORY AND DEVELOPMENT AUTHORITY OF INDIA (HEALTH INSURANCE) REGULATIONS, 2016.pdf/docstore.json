It emphasizes the need for seamless data transfer between TPAs and insurers, preferably electronically, and mandates the transfer of claim settlement files within 15 days. Insurers and TPAs are required to have systems to mitigate fraud and comply with guidelines issued by the Authority.\n\nThe document also states that health insurers must submit returns to the Authority as specified in the guidelines. It repeals the Health Insurance Regulations of 2013 and 2014, with the Chairperson of the Authority empowered to issue clarifications and guidelines to resolve difficulties in applying or interpreting these regulations.\n\nPortability of health insurance policies is detailed, allowing policyholders to switch insurers under certain conditions, such as applying 45 to 60 days before the current policy's renewal date. The new insurer must respond within 15 days of receiving data from the previous insurer, or the proposal is automatically accepted. Portability applies to the sum insured and any accumulated bonus, with no additional charges or commissions for porting. Waiting periods for pre-existing diseases and time-bound exclusions are credited based on the number of years of continuous coverage with the previous insurer.\n\nThe document includes a Portability Form (Annexure-I) for policyholders to fill out when requesting to port their policy, which requires details of the existing and proposed insurance, reasons for portability, and family member details. Policyholders must be aware of any longer waiting periods for certain diseases or treatments in the new policy and agree to observe them.\n\nThe summary captures the key details of the regulations and procedures related to health insurance claims processing, data management, fraud mitigation, submission of returns, repeal and savings, and the portability of health insurance policies as outlined by the IRDAI.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "254d87bf-99a5-41ab-ba56-d946c132a976": {"__data__": {"id_": "254d87bf-99a5-41ab-ba56-d946c132a976", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "f07451ca6740d79ca9d86dbff6119d4936cb63b05c70904bbfc377cd44386fda", "text": "The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) Health Insurance Regulations, 2016, outline the administration of Health plus Life Combi Products, which are insurance products combining life and health insurance.
