Specifically, no act or proceeding of the District Forum, State Commission, or National Commission shall be considered invalid solely due to any vacancy among its members or any defect in its constitution.\n\nThe Act empowers the Central Government to make rules for carrying out specific provisions of the Act, as detailed in various clauses and sections. Similarly, the State Government is also authorized to make rules for implementing certain provisions outlined in different clauses and sections.\n\nFurthermore, any rule made by the Central Government under this Act must be presented before both Houses of Parliament. These rules must be laid out while Parliament is in session for a total of thirty days, which can span one or multiple sessions. If both Houses agree to modify or annul the rule within the session following its presentation, the rule will only take effect in its modified form or not at all. However, such modification or annulment does not affect the validity of actions already taken under that rule.\n\nRules made by the State Government must also be laid before the State Legislature as soon as they are made.\n\nThe document also includes footnotes indicating amendments and insertions to the Act made by Act No. 50 of 1993 and Act No. 34 of 1991, effective from June 18, 1993, and June 15, 1991, respectively.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name":
